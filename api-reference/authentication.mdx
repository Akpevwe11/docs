- This end-point make use of basic authentication.
- the header of your API request should contain the `client-id` and `client-secret` 
- The content-type header must be application/json.
- The verification transaction endpoint require authentication with your `client-id` and `client-secret`.



```bash
'Authorization': 'Basic <client-id:client-secret>'
```



## Signature Validation 

### Overview

Signature validation is a crucial step in processing events or responses received from Swwipe. 
These entities carry a payload that includes an `HMAC` (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) property. 
The purpose of this property is to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data transmitted. The `HMAC` property is generated as a Hexadecimal `HMAC256` hash, 
computed based on a combination of parameters, including `MerchantRef`, `CurrencyCode`, and `Amount`, using the `MerchantSecret` as the secret key.

### Verifying HMAC Property

Before proceeding with the processing of any transaction, it is imperative to validate the `HMAC` 
property to confirm the data's integrity and origin. The following section provides a sample function that
 can be used to obtain the HMAC value for verification.

 Sample Function: `HexHMACHash256`

The`HexHMACHash256` function is used to calculate the `HMAC256` hash for a given input value using the provided `MerchantSecret` key.
It is crucial to construct the input value as the concatenation of `MerchantRef`, `CurrencyCode`, and `Amount`.

```csharp
public static string HexHMACHash256(string value, string maggi) {
    // Convert the MerchantSecret key to bytes
    byte[] keyByte = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(maggi);
    
    // Convert the input value to bytes
    byte[] messageBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(value);
    
    // Initialize an HMACSHA256 hasher with the key
    using (var hasher = new HMACSHA256(keyByte)) {
        // Compute the hash
        byte[] hashMessage = hasher.ComputeHash(messageBytes);
        
        // Convert the hash to a Hexadecimal string format
        return BitConverter.ToString(hashMessage).Replace("-", "").ToLower();
    }
}

```

In the provided function, `value` should be constructed as the concatenation of`MerchantRef`, `CurrencyCode`, and `Amount`, while `maggi` represents the MerchantSecret key. 
By calling this function and comparing the result with the HMAC property received from SwwipePay, you can ensure the authenticity and integrity of the data before proceeding with transaction processing.
